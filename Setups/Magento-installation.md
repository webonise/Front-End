  19. After entering user name and password for Admin you can log into
   Admin Panel in which you will be directed to the following screen. 
  Note: to log into Admin Panel first you have to make changes in the 
  varen.php file. As Magento only accepts real domains and localhost is not a 
  real domain browser does not save cookies so you cannot log in to the Admin 
  Panel .Hence Go to app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/Session/Abstract/Varien.phpÂ  
  and comment the following code :
