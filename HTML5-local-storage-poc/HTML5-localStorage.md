# HTML5 Local Storage / Web storage

Web storage and DOM storage (document object model) are web application software methods and protocols used for storing data in a web browser.
Web storage supports persistent data storage, similar to cookies but with a greatly enhanced capacity and no information stored in the HTTP request header.[2] There are two main web storage
types: local storage and session storage, behaving similarly to persistent cookies and session cookies respectively.
